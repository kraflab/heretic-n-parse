### Heretic-N Parse
The tools included here are designed to parse the heretic-n demo database
in order to merge the files with the new [dsda project](https://github.com/kraflab/dsda-r).
Heretic-N is a competition in which players attempt to complete levels from Heretic as
fast as possible, under a variety of conditions.
It is currently hosted by JCD [here](http://82.66.133.154:85/Heretic-N/).
